Josh Young is the Chief of Staff at New Story - their mission is to pioneer solutions to end global homelessness. New Story is one of the first non-profits to go through Y Combinator and has since built over 3,500 homes in Haiti, El Salvador, and Mexico. In addition, they led the construction of the world's first 3-D printed community and have been featured four times as one of the World's Most Innovative Companies, featured in an Apple TV+ Documentary, and featured on the front of the New York Times. Josh is leading operations on crypto initiatives. In partnership with Galoy and Bitcoin Beach, New Story is building a 200 home community in the heart of El Zonte using Bitcoin. This project will prove Bitcoin can be used for mortgage repayments for the world's poor and ultimately provide more access to affordable housing.
