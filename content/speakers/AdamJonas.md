Together with his colleague Caralie, Jonas co-manages Chaincodeâ€™s educational initiatives, including the residency and online seminars. Last summer, he helped organize the Summer of Bitcoin for Indian students learning how to contribute to open-source Bitcoin/LN projects and is currently focusing his energy on Qala (qala.dev), a program designed to train experienced African developers and match them Bitcoin/LN jobs. He previously worked as an engineer in the education space after transitioning from his former role developing the talents of professional baseball players.
