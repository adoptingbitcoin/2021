# Anders Helseth
 
Anders is a Senior Analyst at Arcane Research. He has been the project lead of the newly launched Arcane report, “The State of Lightning”, and will be presenting the key findings at the Adoption Bitcoin conference. This non-technical in-depth report on the Bitcoin Lightning Network concentrates on current and future adoption and gives an overview of the current ecosystem. Before entering the bitcoin space, Anders specialized in monetary economics and policy. He has extensive experience as a consultant, building data-driven industry reports for various companies and government agencies. An economist by heart, that couldn’t resist the urge to move to a bitcoin career.
