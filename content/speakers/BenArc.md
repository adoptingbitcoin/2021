# Ben Arc
 
From Wales, Ben Arc advocates and educates about Free Open Source Software (FOSS). Since around 2014, he has been building hardware and software for Bitcoin and LN. In this space, Ben encourages people to build their own things and in this way, gain more autonomy while interacting with Bitcoin and Bitcoin devices. LNbits is one of his projects, a free and open-source lightning wallet.
